# Tenshi Fox CSS - celestial-firefox-css

**[🇧🇷 Leia em Português](README-ptbr.md)**

A minimalist CSS "rice" for Firefox, focused on a dark theme with neon pink accents, inspired by the aesthetics of Tenshi Hinanawi (Touhou Project).

The goal is to clean up the interface, center elements, and give a "gamer/hacker" touch to the address bar without sacrificing performance.

## ✨ Features

* **Custom Address Bar:** "Dark mode" background (deep purple) with vibrant neon pink text and icons.
* **Centered Tabs:** Tab text is always centered for a cleaner look.
* **Auto-hiding Bookmarks:** The bookmarks bar remains hidden and only appears when hovering nearby (saving vertical space).
* **Audio Glow:** Tabs playing audio get a neon pink glow.
* **Clean Look:** Hidden 'X' (close) button on inactive tabs.
